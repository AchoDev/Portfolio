How to play

Before playing, you have to choose your deck made up of 6 cards. These can be made of anything you choose, but you can only choose a card once.

There are three types of cards:

Blue Cards: These cards help your other cards in some way. They cannot harm enemy cards directly, instead they buff you or your cards

Green cards: These cards harm the enemy cards directly in some way. This is most likely a debuff

Red cards: These cards attack enemy cards directly. They don’t rely on effects, because they harm the enemy cards through direct attacks 

When the game begins, you are dealt 3 random cards. After that you have 3 Energy Points, which you can spend, while it’s your turn. Placing a card costs one point, but using a card costs more or less, depending on which card you choose. After you place a card, you can either spend your remaining points to use that card or place more cards. When you’re done, you can end your turn. To use a card, hold it with you cursor and drag it on whatever card you want to use it on. These can be either your cards or enemy ones, depending on the color.

Each card has a specific amount of health. When it gets attacked enough, to loose all its health, it dies, looses a life and is sent back to your deck. All cards have 2 lives. Once they loose both, they die completely and are out of the game. Once all cards of a player dies, they loose.
