<p>AmA is a Desktop Application, which acts as a digital vocabulary book. You can add as many words and notes, edit them and give them tags to further organize all the words you learned. Gone are the days of tirelessly writing down each word, trying desperetaly to organize them somehow, while inevitebly awaiting the day you run out of space, IF you use AmA!</p>

<h2>User Manual</h2>

<p>After intalling and starting the program, you should be able to see the main interface. This is where you'll see all your saved words, organized alphabetically.</p>

<h3>Vocabulary</h3>

<p><strong>The top row</strong> consists of each letter in your alphabet. When you click on one of them, you'll only be able to see words that start with that exact letter</p>

<p><strong>To create a new word</strong>, press on the <strong>+</strong> icon in the bottom right corner. After that, enter the desired word in both languages, select a tag if you need one, and press <strong>"Add word"</strong></p>

<p>Tags are used to tag a specific group of words, for example adjectives, nouns or difficult words. <strong>To create a new tag</strong>, press the <strong>"Tags"</strong> button in the top right corner. A menu with all your tags and pages should appear. Press on the <strong>"New Tag"</strong> button to create a tag, then press the <strong>"Edit"</strong> button, then the <strong>"Pencil"</strong> button above your new tag, to give your new tag a name. After that, you can use that tag when creating a new word or edit an already existing word and give it that tag.</p>

<p><strong>To edit a word</strong>, go into the main page and press the <strong>"Pencil"</strong> button next to the desired word. Then you'll be able to see two textboxes and one selector. The first and second textbox represent the word in both languages; the selector changes the words tag. After making your changes, you can either save them, by pressing the <strong>"save"</strong> icon on the right, or you can discard them, by pressing the <strong>"X"</strong> icon next to it.</p>

<h3>Pages</h3>

<p>Pages are used just to write down all kinds of notes. They don't restrict you in any way, unlike the vocabulary section, but you have to organize them yourself.</p>

<p><strong>To create a page</strong>, press the <strong>"Tags"</strong> button in the top right corner. Then press the <strong>"Create new page"</strong> button in the top right corner of the menu. After that, a new page should appear in your list. Press the <strong>"Edit"</strong> button, then the <strong>"Pencil"</strong> button on your new page, to give it a name.</p>

<p>Open the page by just pressing on it, in the <strong>Tags Menu</strong>. After you do that, all the words, the top row and the <strong>+</strong>-button should all disappear and you'll be left with just a blank page. To write something down, just click this page once and write away! To save this page, press the new <strong>"Save"</strong> button in the bottom left corner. Keep in mind, that <strong>Pages DO NOT save automatically! You have to save them manually with the "Save" button</strong>.</p>
