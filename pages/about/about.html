  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <h3>Hello!</h3>

  <p>I am Ahmed Asi, also known as AchoDev. I'm passionate about many areas of programming. I express my passion through all my projects that I've spent countless hours meticulously and carefully crafting.</p>

  <p>I have a strong educational foundation in my field, as I study computer science at BHH in Hamburg in parallel to training to become a software developer one day. I'm very well versed in a range of technologies, tools and programming languages. More in :: Skills. </p>

  <!-- <p>I already knew years ago, that will become a software developer. Before even writing a single line of code or knowing anything about the most abundant languages and-or tools used, I felt a burning desire to write something special. So one day I found out about :: Scratch. After a bit of playing around, I fell in love with it. Since Scratch has a very gentle learning curve, it never felt hard to make anything. After being satisfied with the amount of theoretical knowledge I was able to aquire from playing around, I began my first real Project. I was basically a copy of a popular Indie Game. After a couple of stressful weeks, I finished the game with only a day left to spare, because the game was featured on an open house day at my school.</p> -->

  <p>What sets me apart is my relentless pursuit of excellence, attention to detail, and a dedication to continually expand my knowledge. I'm not just a programmer; I'm a problem solver, a lifelong learner, and a team player. Ã¤ndern noch weil cgpt kopie bhd</p>

  <p>Outside of coding, I have other hobbies, such as reading</p>
